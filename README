Hi! 
Here are two famous algorithms for finding the Fibonacci number by its ordinal number written on Fortran, Golang, PHP,  Python, JavaScript:
- recursive algorithm (files with the name "fr" - fibonacci recursive);
- cycle agorithm (files with the name "fl" - fibonacci loop).
I invite everyone to complement the recursive algorithm with methods able to speed it up.
